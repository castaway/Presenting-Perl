		<h2>Upload Custom HTML</h2>
		<p>
		Presenting Perl intends to allow authors to provide additional HTML containing a description of their talk or links to slides.
		There will soon be a form to help automate the process of uploading custom
		HTML on this page. Until we get that live, if you're the author
		of this talk (or just happen to have collected links to slides
		and similar for us) please send the HTML you wish
		to appear to 
		<a href="mailto:m.keating@shadowcat.co.uk">m.keating(at)shadowcat.co.uk</a>
		for inclusion.
		</p>
<!--
	BUILD FORM HERE!
